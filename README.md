# SaferSit/Sharetribe Web Application

This is a template web application for a Sharetribe Flex marketplace ready to be extended and
customized. It is based on an application bootstrapped with
[create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) with some additions,
namely server side rendering and a custom CSS setup.

## Quick start

If you just want to get the app running quickly to test it out, first install
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), and follow along:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:safersit/project-moab.git             # clone this repository
cd project-moab/                                          # change to the cloned directory
yarn install                                                   # install dependencies
yarn run config                                                # add the mandatory env vars to your local config
yarn run dev                                                   # start the dev server, this will open a browser in localhost:3000
```
